# Bump Plots in Python

This is a library for generating bump charts in python. And it is in its very early stages so any advice is appreciated.

Current goals:

* ranks assume 1 … n as best … worst (choix results are 0-indexed)
* ascending = False, make yaxis and rank axis invertable
* color schemes (using seaborn)
